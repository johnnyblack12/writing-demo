    <div class="text">
    <p>The first UFC PPV of 2022 is just days away, keeping the hearts of fight fans around the world at an elevated pace. When two men built like superheroes are set to 
      face off inside a cage, a first-time viewer is just as captivated as the MMA die-hard.</p>
    <p>It can be hard to resist trying to pick a winner with such an even matchup on paper. France's Ciryl Gane fights with a kickboxing style that is strikingly 
      fast and fluid for a heavyweight near the 265 lb limit. He is coming off a round 3 TKO victory over Derrick Lewis, who was ranked 3rd in the division at the time.
      Holding a glimmering 7-0 record to start his UFC career, Gane appears destined for gold around his waist. It is almost cinematic that his final obstacle 
      on that path takes the form of Cameroon's Francis Ngannou. Ngannou, who now resides full-time in Las Vegas, started his UFC career with a perfect 6-0 record, all 
      by finish, only to have his meteoric rise rerouted back down to Earth by then-champion Stipe Miocic in eary 2018.</p>
    <p>Adding to the drama is the fact that Francis Ngannou achieved his hot start while training at the MMA Factory in Paris, France under Fernand Lopez, Ciryl Gane's 
      current trainer and coach. Ngannou now trains with coach Eric Nicksick at former heavyweight champion Randy Couture's gym, Xtreme Couture MMA in Las Vegas.</p>
    <p>After that lopsided unanimous decision loss in the title shot against Miocic, Ngannou lost another decision in a close but notoriously boring fight with the aforementioned 
      Derrick Lewis. He then put together four straight first round knockout performances against top contenders and former champions, which thrust him back into a title bout with
      Miocic in March, 2021. This time, Ngannou featured a new patient style and vastly improved defense, which set him up for vicious offense that knocked Miocic out cold in the 
      2nd round.</p>
    <p>Standing in the middle of the octagon with that shiny strap around his waist and an 11-2 UFC record, everyone was certain this belt would not leave the waist of "The Predator" for a
      very long time. Ciryl "Bon Gamin" Gane's 2021 made the fight world consider another possibility.</p>
    <h2>The Numbers</h2>
    <p>In parallel with Francis Ngannou's first title shot back at UFC 220, the betting market views Ciryl Gane as a running freight train that cannot be stopped. Major sportsbooks
      have Gane as a -145/-150 favorite heading into fight weekend, similar to how Ngannou's line ended at -190 in his first fight against Stipe Miocic. Back then, the champion in his prime
      defended his title against the rising star. Will UFC 270 be a modern remake of that classic battle?</p>
    <p>Fights can be particularly hard to judge when disparity exists between the size of each athlete's body of work and level of competition, as is the case for our UFC 270 headliners.
      One useful metric in this case is <i>dominance rating</i>, which grades a fighter's body of work fight-by-fight based on method of victory, dominance of the fighter or opponent 
      in that victory, and opponent's ranking at the time of the fight. Scores for each individual fight are distributed tightly around zero. Only wins can yield positive values and losses
      negative values, scaling with the dominance of the victory.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at the raw dominance of Ngannou and Gane's careers thus far:</p>
    <h3>Cumulative Dominance Rating</h3>
    <canvas id="chart1" style="width: 100%"></canvas>
    <p><i>But Ngannou has 6 more UFC fights than Gane. This isn't fair!</i></p>
    <p>Dominance rating shows that Gane's young but dominant UFC career is on on a remarkably similar trajectory to that of the current heavyweight champion. With different sample sizes however,
      this is not a fair comparison and not very useful for predicting the fight. To make a useful prediction between two fighters with different levels of experience, we move away from
      the chart and look at each fighter's <i>true dominance rating</i>, which still takes total UFC success into account but puts greater weight on a fighter's most recent outcomes. With 
      <i>true dominance rating</i> we get a score that rewards fighters who have consistently dominated their division while capturing any declines or increases in momentum.</p>
    <h2>The Pick</h2>
    <p>Francis Ngannou's true dominance rating stands at 12.835 compared to Gane's 4.669. To get our odds, we simply take the difference and normalize it around 10. This 8.166 difference yields
      a 18.166:10 chance for victory for Ngannou, also represented as a 64.5% chance to win or roughly a 1.8:1 favorite. Long story short, our objective system says a bet on Ngannou should pay
      out at -182 and Gane +182. Since the betting market has Ngannou as an underdog around +120/+125, <b>we see great value betting on the champ here.</b></p>
    <p>Still a young man at 35, Ngannou is on the older side for a UFC fighter, and this could be why many see the rising Gane taking over the title here. The problem with that thesis is that the
      fight-by-fight numbers show Ngannou is not only still in his prime but getting better with each fight. That being said, this is an unblievable matchup we are spoiled to watch. No matter
      the odds, any fighter can always finish a fight with one move, no matter how many rounds they lost up to that point. Ciryl Gane can become the most dominant heavyweight in the world with a win
      Saturday night. Or maybe he isn't ready for the title yet, but he wins the rematch against an older Ngannou in a couple years.</p>
    <p>Fighting is far more personal than team sports. Aside from fighters getting personal with each other via fists to the face, fighters regularly expose both their bodies and minds
      to the fans via weigh-ins, faceoffs, and media days, and they have more freedom than other athletes to act out on TV and social media. Scoring fights in your mind like a judge sitting
      octagon-side is the only surefire way to assess a fighter's strengths and weaknesses. However, the excitement of fighting has many fans, bettors, and those of us who identify as both 
      overlooking talent for appearance, attitude, and flash. Such factors can be guilty of skewing betting lines, but a little math can help us demystify where true talent and value lie.</p>
